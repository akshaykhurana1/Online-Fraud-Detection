# Online Payment Fraud Detection
This repository contains code for building a machine learning model to detect fraudulent online payments. As online payment transactions become increasingly popular, so does the incidence of online fraud. This project aims to develop a model that can accurately identify fraudulent transactions from legitimate ones.

# Objective
The primary objective of this project is to train a machine learning model to classify online payments into fraudulent and non-fraudulent categories. The model will utilize historical transaction data collected from Kaggle to learn patterns and characteristics of fraudulent transactions.

# Dataset
The dataset used for this project is sourced from Kaggle and contains historical information about fraudulent transactions. It includes various features such as transaction amount, timestamp, and transaction type. The dataset is pre-processed and ready for training the machine learning model.

# Methodology
**Data Preprocessing**: The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical features.
**Model Selection**: Several machine learning algorithms are evaluated to determine the most suitable model for fraud detection. Algorithms such as Decision tree, MLP, XGBoost, and gradient boosting are considered.
**Model Training**: The selected model is trained using the preprocessed dataset.
**Model Evaluation**: The trained model is evaluated using performance metrics such as accuracy, and F1-score.
# Repository Structure
